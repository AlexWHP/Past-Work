### Klondike (Solitaire)
When learning about data structures at University, October 2019, we were asked to build a game using the dequeue data type for which I built a fully functioning game of Klondike (Solitaire). This was the first project I sunk my teeth into and ran away with, as we were expected to produce a game of similar complexity to Towers of Hanoi. I added an undo, help, hint, auto-complete, and simple AI features which resulted in a complex but fully functioning system.
