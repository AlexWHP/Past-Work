# Past-Work
Included within this repository is a collection of my coding work, some of the example below are not included but highlight some of the broad amount of languages I have had experience with and the applications I have applied them to.

## Python
### Klondike (Solitaire)
When learning about data structures at University, October 2019, we were asked to build a game using the dequeue data type for which I built a fully functioning game of Klondike (Solitaire). This was the first project I sunk my teeth into and ran away with, as we were expected to produce a game of similar complexity to Towers of Hanoi. I added an undo, help, hint, auto-complete, and simple AI features which resulted in a complex but fully functioning system.

### License Plate Detection
This was the conclusionary assignment to my Graphics and Image Processing paper for which we were tasked with collating our previous work on individual image processing techniques into a functioning license plate detector. This is not a robust detector and requires license plates of vehicles to be clearly displayed and only uses image processing for detection. I have included some plates as examples.

### OpenAI Gym Environment (Capstone Course)
For my capstone course, I was a team leader of five other people working on a Python based OpenAI Gym environment. We worked for out client, Josh Bensemenn, to create a hex-grid that is traversable by agents who have selective pressures applied through predators (Stationary, Random, and Patrol) and the need to sustain themselves (Thirst and Hunger). This is to be carried on by Josh to utilise our environment to test the impact of varying levels of artificial conciousness on agent performance using OpenAI gym. I have included a reference to a conference paper which provides greater context to the project in the readme. It was an awesome experience to work in a group setting with a dedicated and intellegent team and to have also had such an interesting project to undertake.

#### Contributions
As team leader, I handled the allocation of workloads, communication with the client, and actively reviewed members progress and commits. 

For the code, I worked on the environment generation algorithm, hex-grid traversal, the interactable visualization of the environment using Pygame, and the action space which allowed animals to interact with each other and objects. I also actively participated by helping others implementations integrate with our existing code.

#### Awards
Best Computer Science Capstone Project - Client Nominated - Runner Up

## C++
### Strategy Game
After playing multiple 4X and Grand Strategy Games a common issue is late game performance. After learning the fundamentals of C++, I decided to push that knowledge further into a design similar to these games geared towards late game performance through abstraction of the fundamental pieces that the game is built on. Ultimately, this project became bogged down within the OpenGL framework as I tried to project a 3D map using a height map and has significant issues when reviewing my code. I have since taken a paper on Graphics utilising OpenGL and worked on a project in a group setting that has set core documentation skills that present an oppurtunity to overcome these issues should I decide to restore and continue this project.
